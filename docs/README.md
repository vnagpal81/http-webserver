                         Domgatix 1.0 HTTP Web Server
                         ============================

A limited use HTTP webserver intended as a pure academic exercise.

Many features during implementation have been inspired from the Apache Tomcat servlet container.

The documentation heavily borrows the structure and language from the Apache Tomcat's own docs 
while the implementation borrows concepts and designs and at a couple of places even source code 
from various open source libraries especially apache httpd and spring core framework.

Following links were referred to again and again during the development cycle:



The nomenclature Dogmatix is based on the canine character in the comix (sic) Asterix attributing 
the server's capabilities to that of a loyal dog's.
