	    ========================================
            Running The Dogmatix 1.0 HTTP Web Server
            ========================================

Dogmatix 1.0 HTTP Web Server requires a Java Standard Edition Runtime
Environment (JRE) version 7.0 or later.

=============================
Running With JRE 7.0 Or Later
=============================

(1) Download and Install a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)

(1.1) Download a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE),
      release version 7.0 or later, from
      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

(1.2) Install the JRE according to the instructions included with the
      release.

      You may also use a full Java Development Kit (JDK) rather than just
      a JRE.


(2) Download and Install Dogmatix 1.0 HTTP Web Server

NOTE:  As an alternative to using a binary distribution, you can
create your own from the source code, as described in "BUILDING.txt".  
You can do the full "release" build and find the created distribution 
in the "target" directory and then proceed with unpacking.

      For the purposes of the remainder of this document, the name
      "DOGMATIX_HOME" is used to refer to the full pathname of that
      directory.


(3) Configure Environment Variables

Dogmatix is a Java application and does not use environment variables. The
variables are used by the Dogmatix startup scripts. The scripts use the variables
to prepare the command that starts Dogmatix.


(3.1) Set DOGMATIX_HOME (optional)

The DOGMATIX_HOME environment variable should be set to the location of the
root directory of the "binary" distribution of Dogmatix.

The Dogmatix startup scripts have some logic to set this variable
automatically if it is absent, based on the location of the startup script
in *nix and on the current directory in Windows. That logic might not work
in all circumstances, so setting the variable explicitly is recommended.


(3.2) Set JRE_HOME or JAVA_HOME (required)

These variables are used to specify location of a Java Runtime
Environment or of a Java Development Kit that is used to start Dogmatix.

The JRE_HOME variable is used to specify location of a JRE. The JAVA_HOME
variable is used to specify location of a JDK.

Using JAVA_HOME provides access to certain additional startup options that
are not allowed when JRE_HOME is used.

If both JRE_HOME and JAVA_HOME are specified, JRE_HOME is used.


(3.3) Using the "setenv" script (optional, recommended)

Apart from DOGMATIX_HOME, all environment variables can be specified in the 
"setenv" script. The script should be placed into DOGMATIX_HOME/bin directory 
and is named setenv.bat (on Windows) or setenv.sh (on *nix). The file has to be
readable.

By default the setenv script file is absent. This file is to be used whenever
environment variables are to be set but not at the shell level but instead 
only for the Dogmatix process.

For example, to configure the JRE_HOME variable you can create the following 
script file:

On Windows, %DOGMATIX_HOME%\bin\setenv.bat:

  set "JRE_HOME=%ProgramFiles%\Java\jre7"
  exit /b 0

On *nix, $DOGMATIX_HOME/bin/setenv.sh:

  JRE_HOME=/usr/java/latest

The DOGMATIX_HOME variable cannot be configured in the setenv script, because 
it is used to locate that file.

All the environment variables described here and the "setenv" script are
used only if you use the standard scripts to launch Dogmatix. For example, if
you have built Dogmatix source as a JAR file which is launched by Java directly 
and does not use the script files, all these env variables will be ignored.


(4) Start Up Dogmatix

(4.1) Dogmatix can be started by executing one of the following commands:

  On Windows:

      %DOGMATIX_HOME%\bin\dogmatix.bat start

  On *nix:

      $DOGMATIX_HOME/bin/dogmatix.sh start

(4.2) After startup, the Dogmatix HTTP web server will be available by visiting:

      http://localhost:4444/

(4.3) Further information about configuring and running Dogmatix can be found in
      the documentation CONFIGURING.txt


(5) Shut Down Dogmatix

(5.1) Dogmatix can be shut down by executing one of the following commands:

  On Windows:

      %DOGMATIX_HOME%\bin\dogmatix.bat stop

  On *nix:

      $DOGMATIX_HOME/bin/dogmatix.sh stop

================
Troubleshooting
================

There are only really 2 things likely to go wrong during the stand-alone
Dogmatix install:

(1) The most common hiccup is when another web server (or any process for that
    matter) has laid claim to port 4444.  This is the default HTTP port that
    Dogmatix attempts to bind to at startup.  To change this, open the file:

       $DOGMATIX_HOME/conf/server.xml

    and search for '4444'.  Change it to a port that isn't in use, and is
    greater than 1024, as ports less than or equal to 1024 require superuser
    access to bind under UNIX.

    Restart Dogmatix and you're in business.  Be sure that you replace the "4444"
    in the URL you're using to access Dogmatix.  For example, if you change the
    port to 1977, you would request the URL http://localhost:1977/ in your
    browser.

(2) The 'localhost' machine isn't found.  This could happen if you're behind a
    proxy.  If that's the case, make sure the proxy configuration for your
    browser knows that you shouldn't be going through the proxy to access the
    "localhost".

    In Firefox, this is under Tools/Preferences -> Advanced/Network ->
    Connection -> Settings..., and in Internet Explorer it is Tools ->
    Internet Options -> Connections -> LAN Settings.
